looking at the image, I count about 20 cells. I can see the cells are the circular structures visible in the image above that have green outlines. The active contour method did nto extract the correct number of cells, as my contouring method had extracted 32 cells from the image. This is off by about 11-12 cells. So, I do not find the active contour method to be very accurate as it is off by over 50% error. This can be due to the fact that the cells are closely bunched, so it is difficult to precisely count the individual cells and their borders. With the human eye, one can easily make the distinction between the individual cells by visually making out the cells—even when their borders are difficult to make out. A preprocessing method to improve the results would be upscaling or scaling the images larger so that the images to make it easier for the computer to make out. The images were scaled smaller, which can make it harder for the computer to analyze. Likewise, the colors make a difference when reading the borders and contours. To make the active contouring method easier, a different color filter or color imaging choice could emphasize the countours more. If the color range was widened and made more broad, the contours would be easier for the computer to recognize through the increased color definition.
